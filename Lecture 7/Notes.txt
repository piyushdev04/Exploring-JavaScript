#Events:
The change in the state of an object is known as an Event
Events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution.

- Mouse events (click, double click etc.)
- Keyboard events (keypress, keyup, keydown)
- Form events (submit etc.)
- Print event & many more


#Event Handling:

    node.event = () => {
        // handle here
    }


#Event Object:
It is a special object that has details about the event.

All event handlers have access to the Event Object's properties and methods.

    node.event = (e) =>  {
        // handle here
    }

    e.target, e.type, e.clientX, e.clientY


#Event Listeners:

    - node.addEventListener(event, callback)
    - node.removeEventListener(event, callback)

    * Note: the callback reference should be same to remove
